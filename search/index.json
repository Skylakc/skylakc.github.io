[{"content":"During my middle school years, I was introduced to model aviation. This is a type of aeromodeling that is powered by electric motors, mainly brushless motors. As my skills grew, I kept trying to make my own brushless motor drivers.\nBeginning In fact, BLDC is driven by a simple, six-tap commutation method. Essentially BLDC is turning the commutator of a brushed DC motor into an electronic switch.\nVery quickly, I made my own driver using a microcontroller.\nDevelopment Then after that, I discovered the TI C2000 series microcontroller\u0026rsquo;s motor drive function library and PMSM motors. the FOC algorithm can bring infinite possibilities to motor drive.\nSo I built a motor lab platform. It was a 57 stepper motor plus an AMT102 optical encoder.\nThen MEMS technology-enabled magnetic encoders started to roll out in large numbers, and I ported the drive algorithms to an ST microcontroller, swapping out the optical encoder for a radial magnet-based magnetic encoder. Eventually a small motor driver board was made.\nNow, motors based on FOC control technology run in all the places in my house that need a motor drive, including my fish tank water pump, computer water pump, air conditioning inverter compressor, fresh air fan and so on.\nI developed variety of driver board to control these motors. (Some of them are sensorless which works in a light load)\n","date":"2022-08-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://skylakc.github.io/p/first-look-at-the-world-of-electric-drives/wave_hu6108c9bf97658a58dc5be04613fc3fd0_697975_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://skylakc.github.io/p/first-look-at-the-world-of-electric-drives/","title":"First look at the world of electric drives"},{"content":"Beginning When I was in high school, I was introduced to flight controls and multirotors.\nI learned what a MultiWii is, and the famous Ardupilot.\nI\u0026rsquo;d be thinking about how to get MultiWii\u0026rsquo;s complicated code to run in the Atmel 328p that I could afford at the time.\nFollowed by Ardupilot running in Atmega2560. I tuned it all the day.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the revamped pixhawk 2.4.8.\nIt also does some weird stuff in between, like the Y3 craft that relies on rudder control of the third axis tension vector angle to counteract spin.\nAnd the giant eight-axle, with a wheelbase of 1200mm.\nDuring my university years, I once again became involved with drones. This time, I won the national second prize of the TI Cup, the highest level of electronic competitions for university students, by designing the X4 copter myself.\nThis project ended up being my final year project, and it earned the title of outstanding thesis.\n","date":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://skylakc.github.io/p/my-undergraduate-design/fly_hu4fcf10fbd8642685e40dd451592ad92d_204081_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://skylakc.github.io/p/my-undergraduate-design/","title":"My Undergraduate Design"},{"content":"Me and lighting.\nThe duration of this project spanned my middle school and undergraduate years, and with each new location I always wanted to improve the design and implement it.\nBeginning At first, I just wanna make a switching power supply. When I was came across to the NE555 chip, I found the mystery of AC world.\nThis is a CD4046 based PLL Driver.\nSo I changed my target and make a inverter. At the same time, I searched a interesting device which could released over 1,000,000 voltages. It was invented by Nicola Tesla.\nOf course, the load of my inverter is Tesla Coil. To verified the functions of the coil, my first target is make a SGTC (Spark Gap Tesla Coil).\nThere is a HV generator and a inverter. At that time, I was a junior high school student. So my solution is Classical ZVS inverter + CRT Line output transformer.\nHere are the arc of the output, 15kV DC Apporx.\nGen 1 To replace the spark gap, we need to artificially control the coil with chips and transistors.\nAll circuit cited from Steve UD1.3\nBased 74HC74/74HC08/74HC04\nThe isolator is HFBT1414/HFBT2412 ST Optical Fiber\nThe interrupt signal transmitted through Fiber.\nFor inverter, I chose full bridge topology. The IGBT driver used magnetical isolatator (GDT, Gate Driver Transformer, made of Ethernet Wire)\nTo control the working duration, I designed a interrupt signal generator. It based on NE555 and LM393.\nHere are the testing site. The MCU responsible for generating a fake primary working excitation to trig the D trigger.\nAnd the oscilloscope result.\nThis is the current sensor and feedback sensor.\nThen I mounted the relevant equipment to the coil.\nFinally, I got the whole device and I decided to test in my home. I have made a total of two coils based on different calculation parameters. My mom and dad helped me with the winding.\nActually, the result is not good. I have to change my solution and debug the whole system.\nGen 2 Following the prompt, I reached out to the CPLD. Here are the next gen. driver. The solution based on CPLD Altera MAX II, which integrated whole door circuit into one chip. The new GDT driver used P-N MOSFET FDD8424H to instead of IRFP540/9540 totem pole MOS amplifier.\nAt this time, I recalculated the resonance parameters, taking into account the conclusions of enthusiasts in other parts of the world.\nThis time the result is very significant, at this point the resonant current has reached 100Amps according to the calculation, the IGBT is rated at 50Amps.\nIn order to be able to use the previous secondary coil and get better results, I set out to improve a new generation of inverters, this time with 5 IGBTs per arm in parallel.\nI tested the coil at my home and my high school.\nTwisting As time went by I came to the university, because of some trivial things, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t concentrate on doing higher power testing. So I switched to doing some optimization design.\nHere are the new gen. driver based on CPLD Xilinx CoolRunner II. In this board, I tried to design some protect circuit and faster PWM Signal in CPLD. Such as a Phase shift circuit to protect the IGBT. Also, I add a isolated IGBT driver though Fiber to instead of Gate Driver Transformer(GDT).\nThe new platform in my lab.\nIn this time, I tried to use the IGBT modules to build the full bridge inverter.\nBut It didn\u0026rsquo;t last long, as the program was quickly suspended by the school and terminated after I lobbied ineffectively.\nRebirth Restart, new life\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nI still remember when I was in my third year of junior high school, my dad gave me 3,000 RMB to realize my dream, and in that year, I built an oversized IGBT inverter. But the lack of theoretical knowledge made me never successfully and safely drive up this big guy.\nThese are the resonant capacitors prepared at that time.\nAnd this is the secondary coil that was prepared at the time.\nBefore I did my graduation defense, I was reminded again of my childhood aspirations, so I redesigned the new driver circuit. The new driver based on Infineon Cypress PSoc, which integrated in FPGA, PGA and ARM.\nAfter that, I developed a GUI base on Node.js. It is a digital operate pannel with various sensor data.\nI hope that someday I can actually finish and close this 10-year project!\n","date":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","image":"https://skylakc.github.io/p/my-tesla-coils/coil_hu03d9be687f0104b9c555c7ca47df571a_103811_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://skylakc.github.io/p/my-tesla-coils/","title":"My tesla coils"},{"content":"I bought a 12 used car, which model is Volkswagen Golf MK4 1.8L Naturally Aspirated.\nAfter an accident, I have to repair my car.\nThe car is built on the same platform as the Audi TT MK1 named PQ34.\nAs a result, I\u0026rsquo;ve used a variety of processes to modify my car, including but not limited to add a new turbocharger\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nTeardown Engine This is the cylinder head.
